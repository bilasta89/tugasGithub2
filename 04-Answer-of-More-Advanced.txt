3. What is the difference between git stash pop and git stash apply. When would you use one over the other?

Answer
1. git reset is used when we want to unstage a file and bring our changes back to the working directory. 
git reset can also be used to remove commits from the local repository.
   git revert git revert is used to remove the commits from the remote repository. 
Since now our changes are in the working directory, letâ€™s add those changes to the staging area and commit them.

2. Git merge is a command that allows you to merge branches from Git. 
Git rebase is a command that allows developers to integrate changes from one branch to another. 

3. difference between git stash pop and apply involves the stash history. When a developer uses the git stash apply command, the most recently saved stash overwrites files in the current working tree but leaves the stash history alone. 
In contrast, the pop command restores files but then deletes the applied stash.
